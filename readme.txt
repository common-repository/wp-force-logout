Forcefully log out users from your WordPress site, manage online status, and track last login activity.

== Description ==

WPForce Logout allows administrators to log out all or selected users with a single click, enhancing the security of user accounts. It helps protect against brute force attacks and allows you to manage compromised accounts by forcing logout. 

If you need to work on your WordPress website without any users being logged in, this plugin allows you to force all user accounts to be logged out. Additionally, if you suspect that your WordPress site is hacked, forcing logout will help you secure your site. This plugin is also useful for membership or pay-per-view sites to prevent password sharing among users.

You can easily view online/offline users, last login activity from the users tab.
